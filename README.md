Welcome to the ATC Aircraft Simulator! Here’s everything you need to know to control traffic like a pro.

## 🖱 Spawning Aircraft

1. Press `V`, `D`, or `A` to choose a spawn type:

   * `V` = VFR Aircraft (N#####)
   * `D` = IFR Departure
   * `A` = Arrival (no strip created)

2. Then **click anywhere** on the map to place the aircraft.

## ✏️ Drawing Flight Paths

1. Press `P` to enter path-drawing mode.
2. **Left-click and drag** from anywhere on the screen.
3. When you release, the **closest aircraft** will follow that path slowly.

## ❌ Deleting Aircraft

1. Press `X` to enter delete mode.
2. Click on an aircraft to remove it.

## ⛔ Exiting Modes

## 📋 Flight Strips

* Every IFR/VFR spawn creates a **flight strip** (not for arrivals).

## 📍 Visuals

* Aircraft are **white dots** with white callsigns floating above.
